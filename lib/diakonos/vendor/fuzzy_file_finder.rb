# The "fuzzy" file finder provides a way for searching a directory
# tree with only a partial name. This is similar to the "cmd-T"
# feature in TextMate (http://macromates.com).
#
# Usage:
#
#   finder = FuzzyFileFinder.new
#   finder.search("app/blogcon") do |match|
#     puts match[:highlighted_path]
#   end
#
# In the above example, all files matching "app/blogcon" will be
# yielded to the block. The given pattern is reduced to a regular
# expression internally, so that any file that contains those
# characters in that order (even if there are other characters
# in between) will match.
#
# In other words, "app/blogcon" would match any of the following
# (parenthesized strings indicate how the match was made):
#
# * (app)/controllers/(blog)_(con)troller.rb
# * lib/c(ap)_(p)ool/(bl)ue_(o)r_(g)reen_(co)loratio(n)
# * test/(app)/(blog)_(con)troller_test.rb
#
# And so forth.
class FuzzyFileFinder
  # This is the exception that is raised if you try to scan a

  # +pattern+ is interpreted thus:

  # * "foo" : look for any file with the characters 'f', 'o', and 'o'

  # * "foo/bar" : look for any file with the characters 'b', 'a',
  #   and 'r' in its basename (discounting directory names). Also,
  #   any successful match must also have at least one directory
  #   element matching the characters 'f', 'o', and 'o' (in that
  #   order.
  # * "foo/bar/baz" : same as "foo/bar", but matching two
  #   directory elements in addition to a file name of "baz".
  #
  # Each yielded match will be a hash containing the following keys:
  #
  # * :path refers to the full path to the file
  # * :directory refers to the directory of the file
  # * :name refers to the name of the file (without directory)
  # * :highlighted_directory refers to the directory of the file with
  #   matches highlighted in parentheses.
  # * :highlighted_name refers to the name of the file with matches
  #   highlighted in parentheses
  # * :highlighted_path refers to the full path of the file with
  #   matches highlighted in parentheses
  # * :abbr refers to an abbreviated form of :highlighted_path, where
  #   path segments without matches are compressed to just their first
  #   character.
  # * :score refers to a value between 0 and 1 indicating how closely
  #   the file matches the given pattern. A score of 1 means the
  #   pattern matches the file exactly.
