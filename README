= Diakonos

== REQUIREMENTS

- Ruby 1.9.1

Diakonos is built to run on Linux, but may run under other flavours of UNIX.
It is known NOT to work under Windows (unless using Cygwin).

Currently, Diakonos appears to have some issues on Ruby 1.9.2, so usage of
Ruby 1.9.1 is recommended.


== DOWNLOAD

The latest stable tarballs can be acquired from

  http://purepistos.net/diakonos

The latest development code can be obtained from github:

  git clone git://github.com/Pistos/diakonos.git


== INSTALLATION

ruby install.rb --help
ruby install.rb [installation parameters]

You may need root privileges on the system in order to install to system-wide
places like /usr .  However, Diakonos runs perfectly well in userspace, such
as under ~/usr .

If you use RVM[1], note that Diakonos installs very easily into an RVM-based
Ruby.

  diakonos <filename> [filename...]
  diakonos -m <regexp>

or, for other options and arguments,

  diakonos --help

For help using Diakonos, simply press F1 or Shift-F1 from within the editor to
use the interactive help system.
