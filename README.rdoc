= Diakonos

== REQUIREMENTS

- Ruby 1.9.2+

Diakonos is built to run on Linux, but may run under other flavours of UNIX.
It is known NOT to work under Windows (unless using Cygwin).


== DOWNLOAD

The latest stable tarballs can be acquired from

  http://diakonos.pist0s.ca/

The latest development code can be obtained from github:

  git clone git://github.com/Pistos/diakonos.git


== INSTALLATION

  ruby install.rb --help
  ruby install.rb [installation parameters]

You may need root privileges on the system in order to install to system-wide
places like /usr .  However, Diakonos runs perfectly well in userspace, such
as under ~/usr .

=== RVM

If you use RVM[1], note that Diakonos installs very easily into an RVM-based
Ruby.

After installing Diakonos under RVM, you can symlink to the installed binary,
and that will allow you to use Diakonos with that specific Ruby version no
matter what the current RVM Ruby is.  Example:

  mkdir -p ~/bin
  cd ~/bin
  ln -s /home/pistos/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/bin/diakonos

Then ensure that ~/bin is in your PATH.

== UNINSTALLATION

  diakonos --uninstall


== USAGE

Run with any of these:

  diakonos [filename...]
  diakonos -s <session-name>
  diakonos -m <regexp>

or, for other options and arguments,

  diakonos --help

For help using Diakonos, simply press F1 or Shift-F1 from within the editor to
use the interactive help system.
