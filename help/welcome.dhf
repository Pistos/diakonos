# Welcome to Diakonos!

Hello, and welcome to Diakonos!  My name is Pistos; I am the author of Diakonos,
and I would like to thank you for trying the Diakonos text editor.

I have crafted Diakonos with ease of use in mind, so I hope you find it the
most easy-to-use console text editor available for Linux.  If you have any
suggestions, questions or comments, please share your thoughts in the ##pistos
channel of the Libera IRC network.

## Getting Started

Press <F1> at any time to activate Diakonos' interactive help system.

## Gnome Terminal

Gnome Terminal by default has several keyboard shortcuts which conflict with
Diakonos.  For a smoother Diakonos experience, you should disable as many of
these as you are comfortable with.  To edit Gnome Terminal's keyboard
shortcuts, go to the Edit menu, then select Keyboard Shortcuts.  Double click
a shortcut and press Backspace to disable it; repeat for each shortcut you
wish to disable.

## Removing the Welcome Message

To stop this welcome message from appearing, edit the configuration file (by
pressing <F12>), add the line "suppress_welcome true", and press <Ctrl-S> to
save your change.
