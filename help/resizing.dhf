# Resizing Diakonos

In most cases, Diakonos can automatically detect when the wrapping terminal or
console changes size (due to a window resize or font change), and redraw
itself.

On some systems, however, Diakonos cannot handle a terminal resize.  If your
system exhibits problems after resizing, try this bash command before starting
Diakonos:

  shopt -s checkwinsize

Pressing <Ctrl-Alt-R> will force Diakonos to redraw itself.
